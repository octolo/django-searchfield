---

## REQUIRED RULES

### Language and Communication

- **Language**: English only
  - Code
  - Comments
  - Docstrings

## Project Overview (INFORMATIONAL)

**Django SearchField** is a Django library that provides a field type for automatically generating concatenated values by combining multiple model fields.

### Core Functionality

1. **SearchField**: A Django CharField that combines multiple source fields into a concatenated search-indexed value
2. **Automatic generation**: Values are generated automatically before saving
3. **Duplicate removal**: Duplicate values from source fields are removed before concatenation
4. **Type formatting**: Automatically formats dates, numbers, booleans
5. **Decorator support**: Use `@add_searchfield()` to automatically add multiple SearchField fields

### Available Components

- `SearchField`: Main field class that combines multiple source fields
- `add_searchfield`: Decorator to automatically add SearchField instances to models

---

## Architecture (REQUIRED)

- Field-based architecture for concatenated value generation
- Fields are automatically generated before saving
- All source code in `src/` directory
- Source layout: `src/searchfield/`

---

├── service.py               # Main service entry point (qualitybase)
└── pyproject.toml          # Project configuration
```

### Key Directories

- `src/searchfield/fields.py`: SearchField class
- `src/searchfield/decorators.py`: add_searchfield decorator
- `tests/`: All tests using pytest

---

## Command Execution (ABSOLUTE)

- **Always use**: `./service.py dev <command>` or `python service.py dev <command>`
- **Always use**: `./service.py quality <command>` or `python service.py quality <command>`
- **Always use**: `./service.py django <command>` or `python service.py django <command>`
- Never execute commands directly without going through these entry points

---

## Code Standards (REQUIRED)

### Typing and Documentation

- All public functions and methods **must** have complete type hints
- Use **Google-style docstrings** for:
  - Public classes
  - Public methods
  - Public functions
- Document raised exceptions in docstrings where relevant

### Testing

- Use **pytest** exclusively
- All tests must live in the `tests/` directory
- New features and bug fixes require corresponding tests

### Linting and Formatting

- Follow **PEP 8**
- Use configured tools:
  - `ruff`
  - `mypy`
- Use the configured formatter:
  - `ruff format`

---

## Code Quality Principles (REQUIRED)

- **Simplicity first**: Write the simplest possible solution. Avoid complexity unless clearly necessary.
- **Minimal dependencies**: Minimize dependencies to the absolute minimum. Only add when essential functionality cannot be reasonably implemented otherwise. Always prefer standard library.
- **No over-engineering**: Do not add abstractions, patterns, or layers unless they solve a real problem or are clearly needed.
- **Comments**: Comments are minimal and only when they resolve ambiguity or uncertainty. Do not comment what the code already states clearly. Do not add comments that reiterate obvious logic.
- **Separation of concerns**: One responsibility per module
- **Good factorization**: Factorize code when it improves clarity and reduces duplication, but only if it doesn't add unnecessary complexity

---

## Module Organization (REQUIRED)

- Single Responsibility Principle
- Logical grouping of related functionality
- Clear public API via `__init__.py`
- Avoid circular dependencies
- Source code in `src/` directory

---

## Qualitybase Integration (ABSOLUTE)

- `qualitybase` is an installed package (used via service.py)
- Always use standard Python imports from `qualitybase.services` when needed
- No path manipulation: Never manipulate `sys.path` or use file paths to import qualitybase modules
- Direct imports only: Use `from qualitybase.services import ...` or `import qualitybase.services ...`
- Standard library imports: Use `importlib.import_module()` from the standard library if needed for dynamic imports
- Works everywhere: Since qualitybase is installed in the virtual environment, imports work consistently across all projects

---

## Field Development (REQUIRED)

### Creating SearchField

SearchField is read-only, not unique by default (allows homonyms):

```python
from searchfield import SearchField

class MyModel(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    code = models.IntegerField()
    date = models.DateField()
    
    search_field = SearchField(
        source_fields=["name", "code", "date"],
        max_length=200,
    )
```

### Default Properties

- `unique=False`: Not unique by default (homonyms allowed); pass unique=True to enforce
- `editable=False`: Always read-only
- `blank=True`, `null=True`: Optional (empty if all source fields are empty)

### Value Generation

- Values are generated in `pre_save()` method
- Duplicates from source fields are removed before concatenation
- Source fields are properly formatted (dates, numbers, etc.)

---

## Decorator Development (REQUIRED)

### Using add_searchfield Decorator

The decorator automatically adds SearchField instances to models:

```python
from searchfield import add_searchfield

@add_searchfield(search_field=["title", "id"], slug=["title", "category"])
class Article(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    category = models.CharField(max_length=50)
```

### Required Behavior

- Decorator accepts keyword arguments (field_name: list of source fields)
- Fields are added using `add_to_class()`
- All fields have appropriate defaults (max_length, etc.)

---

## Environment Variables (REQUIRED)

- `ENVFILE_PATH`
  - Path to `.env` file to load automatically
  - Relative to project root if not absolute
- `ENSURE_VIRTUALENV`
  - Set to `1` to automatically activate `.venv` if it exists

---

## Error Handling (REQUIRED)

- Always handle errors gracefully
- Use appropriate exception types
- Provide clear, actionable error messages
- Do not swallow exceptions silently
- Document exceptions in docstrings where relevant
- Handle API failures with proper error handling when appropriate

---

## Configuration and Secrets (ABSOLUTE)

- Never hardcode:
  - API keys
  - Credentials
  - Tokens
  - Secrets
- Use environment variables or Django settings
- Clearly document required configuration

---

## Versioning (REQUIRED)

- Follow **Semantic Versioning (SemVer)**
- Update versions appropriately
- Clearly document breaking changes

---

## CLI System (INFORMATIONAL)

Django SearchField uses qualitybase's service system:

- Services accessed via `./service.py <service> <command>`
- Available services: `dev`, `quality`, `django`, `publish`

---

## Anti-Hallucination Clause (ABSOLUTE)

If a requested change is:
- Not supported by this document
- Not clearly aligned with the existing codebase
- Requiring assumptions or invention

You must:
1. Stop
2. Explain what is unclear or conflicting
3. Ask for clarification

Do not guess. Do not invent.
